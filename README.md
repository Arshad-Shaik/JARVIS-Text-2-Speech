<div align="center"> <img src="https://media3.giphy.com/media/wkSyGueYTnk40/giphy.webp" alt="JARVIS TTS Demo" width="400"/> </div>

A dynamic and interactive Python GUI application built with Tkinter that converts text into natural, customizable speech. This project mimics an AI assistant interface, offering users control over voice gender and speech rate for a personalized experience.

## üìñ Situation-Task-Action-Result (STAR Method)
**Situation:** Text-to-speech (TTS) technology is crucial for accessibility, productivity, and user engagement, but many tools lack a simple, visually appealing interface.

**Task:** Design and develop an intuitive desktop application that provides a seamless and customizable text-to-speech conversion experience with an engaging user interface.

**Action:**
Engineered a responsive GUI using Tkinter, integrating a dynamic animated GIF background for a visually engaging user experience.
Implemented core text-to-speech functionality using the pyttsx3 library, providing robust, offline-capable speech synthesis.
Architected user-customizable settings including voice gender (Male/Female) and speech rate (Turbo/Average/Unrushed) to personalize the output.
Enhanced UI/UX with custom icons, combo boxes for settings, and a clean layout focused on usability.

**Result:** Successfully delivered a fully functional and aesthetically pleasing desktop application that serves as an effective tool for generating high-quality, customizable speech from text, demonstrating strong skills in GUI development and Python programming.
