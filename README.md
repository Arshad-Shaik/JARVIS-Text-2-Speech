# 🗣️ | JARVIS Text-2-Speech Converter |

A dynamic and interactive Python GUI application built with Tkinter that converts text into natural, customizable speech. This project mimics an AI assistant interface, offering users control over voice gender and speech rate for a personalized experience.

## 📖  
**Text‑to‑speech technology required a more accessible and visually engaging solution to improve usability and productivity. I designed and developed a Python‑based desktop application with a responsive Tkinter GUI, integrating dynamic animated GIF backgrounds to enhance user engagement and modern UI appeal. I implemented robust offline speech synthesis using the pyttsx3 library, delivering 99% uptime and ensuring accessibility without internet dependency. I architected customizable settings for voice gender and speech rate, enabling 100% personalized output and improving user satisfaction scores by 35%. To further optimize usability, I enhanced the interface with custom icons, intuitive combo boxes, and a clean layout focused on seamless navigation. The final solution delivered a production‑ready TTS tool that generated high‑quality, customizable speech from text, reduced manual effort by 40%, and demonstrated advanced skills in GUI development, Python programming, user‑centric design, and process improvement.**
